The worst financial decision I ever made was not investing in real estate while I was in 7th grade. The second-worst financial decision I ever made was pursuing a music degree.

I'm only half-kidding. While my undergraduate music program cost about the same as a small house, I met a lot of great people (sort of) and got to do a lot of great things (sort of) that I wouldn't have happened across in a different degree program.

At this point, I can't un-sign the student loans I took or give back to the school all the knowledge and experiences it gave me. I can only reflect on my time there. If you, reader, who happened to stumble into this corner of the internet, happen to be considering attending music school, I hope you can gain some insight or understaning from the experiences I share in this post.
