# Starting a Blog
---

> TLDR; This is primarily for me.

I've thought about starting a blog like this for a while now. Perhaps the idea was seeded in me after reading [some stellar writing published by a friend](https://renzol2.github.io/is390), or maybe after reading [the blogs of my professors](https://www.geoffreychallen.com/essays). If they have so many interesting thoughts and discoveries to share, I must have some also? Maybe I got the idea after attempting to start journaling multiple times over past few years. I'm not sure how exactly I got to this point, but the gist of it is: I have a lot of thoughts, and sometimes I want to let them out in way way or another, whether it's for sharing or for venting.

I have sort of mixed feelings about doing this. I've never really been one to share my thoughts or feelings too much (especially with strangers), and this is very much that. The veil of internet anonymity definitely lessens my anxiety about this, but I'm not sure how to feel about my friends, peers, and superiors potentially reading all this. 

In the end, I think I'm ok with it. I've been working on prioritizing myself and my mental health recently, so that's the most important part. Why should I care if someone reads this? This is a place where I can be (mostly) unfiltered, and where I can express myself however I want. If somebody sees this, then I hope it gives them a clearer picture of who I am.

From a professional perspective, posting my writings about the professional or technical things I do both helps me better retain information and provides me have a way to quickly share something I've done with others. During an internship I've held during the summer and fall of 2022, I've written a lot of documentation about various projects I've completed. I've been looking for a more formal or polished way to share this that isn't [a GitHub repo full of markdown files](https://github.com/rgildiaz/ITI).

Also from a similar professional development standpoint, building a blog is (with my current skillset) no easy task. I'm fairly new to React and JavaScript in general, so this is a a project I can advertise on my resume that also happens to carry some sort of personal weight.

I think that blogs are sort of like modern time capsules. You might write and publish a blog post during one point of your life, forget both the action of posting it and the actual content over some period of time, and stumble across it years later with different perspectives, memories, and experiences. While the thought of time passing does make me feel anxious, I do hope that I stumble across this years down the line, and I hope that it makes me feel some sort of way&mdash;be it embarrassed, nostalgic, or upset.

If you read this and you know me personally, please reach out! If we met once in passing, I promise that I want to get to know you better. If we have years of history, I'd enjoy talking again. If you don't know me at all but whatever I happen to write has any impact on you at all, please also reach out! I'd love to make new friends or hear a different perspective.

I appreciate your time, and I hope you find something useful here :)
