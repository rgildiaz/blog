<!-- My least favorite part of cog-life (past whole the human suffering part) is playing _The Minigame_: all the extra things you have to do as an employee in order to climb up the career ladder. I hate that less-qualified people are promoted earlier just because they talk to the manager more. Or that  -->

<!-- Sometimes I think about how my life could've been different. In college, I had a little bit of an option between pursuing a career in music or pursuing one in technology. I could have made a humble living teaching music lessons and working a day job (and paying off my loans until I'm 60). Maybe I'm a little bit morally corrupt, now contributing to the machine that is capitalist America. I could've been a part of the solution, giving back to society and retaining my humanity. -->

<!-- This view on things is a little disingenuous. It's not so simple as "tech bad art good". People are complex and can contribute to society in many ways at the same time. I can still be an artist while working as a software engineer.  -->

<!-- I don't really know where I stand on this. Cog-life has treated me well so far, and I'm not really sure what else I could do outside of that.  -->
